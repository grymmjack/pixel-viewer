# SessionStart hook for Claude Code on the web.
#
# Why this exists: pixelview has one git dependency (icy_parser_core, from
# github.com/mkrueger/icy_tools). In the web sandbox, outbound github *git* access
# is routed through a repo-scoped proxy that only permits THIS repo, so a fresh
# `cargo build`/`cargo test` can't fetch that dependency (the proxy 403s). This
# hook removes that scoped-proxy rewrite for github.com so cargo fetches the
# dependency directly through the session's general (network-policy-governed)
# egress proxy — exactly what a normal clone does.
#
# Scope / safety:
#   * It only acts in the remote web environment ($CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE) and only
#     when the scoped-proxy rewrite is actually present, so it is a no-op on your
#     local machines and for anyone else cloning the repo. Nothing about the
#     project's dependencies, Cargo.toml, or Cargo.lock changes — everyone else
#     keeps building exactly as before.
#   * It removes ONLY the `https://github.com/` -> local-proxy rewrite. Commit
#     signing, the repo's own origin remote (an explicit proxied URL, untouched),
#     and the ssh->https rewrites are all left intact.

# Remove any global `url.<…>.insteadOf = https://github.com/` rewrite that points
# github through the local repo-scoping proxy. The proxy port changes per session,
# so match it dynamically (by the local_proxy@127.0.0.1 marker) rather than pinning.
